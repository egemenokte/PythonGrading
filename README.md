# PythonGrading
Course Grading Using Python
-Students are grouped based on type. Each type can have their own grading scheme
-Name, ID, email and Type columns are mandatory. Others should be in the form of "Assignment" for single type or "Assignment X" for multiple
-Please make sure the column names in percentages match the column names on Students. (Exluding the numbers)
-In Percentages, if all assignments are weighed equally, please input the total percentage, otherwise input contribution of each assignment
-To remove the lowest of any type, enter the number of assignments to be removed. Only works if all assignments are weighed equally
